Client Onboarding Assistant (AWS)
Overview

Tech Stack: AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB/S3), HTML, JavaScript, Python, VS Code / Codespaces

The Client Onboarding Assistant is a cloud-based automation tool that streamlines the intake of new client information for businesses. Clients submit their details via a simple web form, which is processed by AWS Lambda, securely stored in the cloud, and confirmed instantly to the user.

This project demonstrates serverless architecture, cloud automation, and end-to-end workflow management. It’s free-tier safe and fully portfolio-ready.

Tech Stack
	
AWS API Gateway	API endpoint	Secure, scalable serverless entry point
AWS Lambda	Backend logic	Handles client data processing and validation
AWS S3 / DynamoDB	Data storage	Secure, reliable, and structured storage
VS Code / Codespaces	Development environment	Cloud-ready, fast, integrates with Python and AWS
Python 3	Lambda logic	Easy processing and integration with AWS services
Virtual Environment (venv)	Dependency management	Isolates libraries for reproducibility
System Architecture

How it works:

- Client opens the HTML form in a browser.
- Client submits name, company type, and “what do you need help with.”
- Frontend sends a JSON request to API Gateway.
- AWS Lambda receives the request, validates the data, and processes it.
- Lambda stores the client info in DynamoDB or S3.
- Lambda sends a confirmation response back to the frontend.
- Frontend updates the UI to show success or error.


Business Value

- Automates client intake → eliminates manual entry.
- Reduces errors → validates input fields before storage.
- Immediate confirmation → clients get instant feedback.
- Free-tier safe → serverless, cost-effective, and scalable.

Target Users:

- Small to medium-sized businesses onboarding clients.
- Freelancers or consultants managing multiple client intakes.
- Agencies needing structured client data storage.

Use Case Examples:

- Digital marketing agencies capturing new client info.
- Consulting firms automating client intake.
- Startups managing early customer onboarding efficiently.
- Deployment Process
