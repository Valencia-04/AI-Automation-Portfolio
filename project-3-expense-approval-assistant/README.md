Expense Approval 

Overview


Tech Stack: Streamlit, Python (Pandas, OpenPyXL), Excel, Browser-based UI

This project is an Expense Analyzer web app that allows users to quickly upload their expense files (Excel/CSV), view interactive summaries, and download processed reports.

It is lightweight, user-friendly, and runs entirely in the browser using Streamlit—making expense management seamless for non-technical users.

Key Features

- Upload Excel/CSV files with expenses
- View expenses in an interactive, filterable table
- Generate instant summaries (totals, categories, highlights)
- Download the processed results as an Excel file
- Fast, local-first, zero debugging setup (Streamlit app)

Planned Premium Features

- AI-powered insights on spending habits
- Category auto-detection (e.g., groceries, transport, utilities)
- Visualization dashboards with charts
- Multi-user authentication & saved sessions

Tech Stack

- Python – core business logic (Pandas for data processing)
- treamlit – browser-based user interface
- Pandas – data cleaning, analysis, and summaries
- OpenPyXL – Excel export functionality
- Browser (Streamlit UI) – where users interact with the app
- Visual Studio Code – development environment
- GitHub – version control and portfolio-ready project structure

How it works:

- User uploads an expense file via the browser (CSV/XLSX).
- Streamlit app (running app.py) reads the file using Pandas.
- Python processes and summarizes expenses.
- Streamlit displays
- Interactive table
- Summary (totals, breakdowns)
- User downloads a new processed Excel file.
- File is saved locally for the user.

Business Value

This project demonstrates how simple data apps can provide immediate value to individuals and small businesses:

- Saves time on manual expense tracking.
- Provides clear summaries without Excel formulas.
- No installation or setup complexity—just upload and use.
